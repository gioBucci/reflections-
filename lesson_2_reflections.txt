What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing the repository is the first step to start tracking the history of the 
files contained in the folder where the repository is initialized. By running git init
no files is being tracked yet and no commit is submitted yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area containes the file and changes we have decided to track.
It doesn't save a snapshot of such files until we commit it to the repository.
The working directory is the location where the repository is stored locally. 
The repository is a system of metadata that tracks the hystory of committed changes
to the working directory.
